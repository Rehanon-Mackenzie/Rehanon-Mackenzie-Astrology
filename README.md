## **Current Features Common to all Pages**

#### **Favicon**

* The favicon is a small image that displays in the browser tab.

* The favicon is a doodle of the planet Mercury.  This was chosen because Mercury is a planet people have head of inconjunction with astrology and is the ruler of my Gemini sun so in keeping with the flow of information provided about me on the website.
* It was taken from the Icons8 website and is credited in the Media Section below
