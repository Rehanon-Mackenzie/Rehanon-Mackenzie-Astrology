      <p>Hey! My name is Rehanon and in case you're wondering I am Gemini Sun, Leo Moon and Scorpio rising so I was always going to be enamoured with the stars. I have been interested in how we tick ever since I was a little girl.  I grew up with a Nan who was very much a kitchen witch.  It wasn't unitl I was at school I realised not everyone had their tea leaves read or washed the front door down with mint for good luck and prosperity. </p>
      <p>Then a few years ago I found myself at a crossroads and leaning into astrology at a much deeper level as another means of assessing how I was and what I wanted.  I trained as an evolutionary astrologer.  I love this take on astrology because it really give folks a base to find out about the gifts and growth areas in their chart and provides practical guidance on how to flow with life rather than against it.</p>
      <p>I can't wait to help you unpick your own chart and truly work out who you are and what you came here for.  My approach is light-hearted and down to earth but provides a clear roadmap to your best chapter yet.</p>
