#### **Color Scheme:**
​
I used online palette generator Coolors to generate the following:

<br>

![Colour Palette](docs/images/colour-palette.png)

​I chose these colours because they are closely associated with spirituality specifically the chakra points.  These include purple for the crown chakra which is associated with higher wisdom.  Blue through the throat chakra and speaking from a place of wisdom. Finally, raspberry pink is associated with passion, excitement and creativity which is always what I hope a birth chart reading will give to people especially when they come for one when they are at a significant cross roasds in their life.

#### **Typography**
​
* Throughout the page, the following fonts are used:
    * Hind Madurai ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Hind+Madurai&display=swap') - I had researched fonts associated with spirituality and astrology and this was one that was suggested and I trialled it and liked it.  
    * Lora ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lora&display=swap') - One of the other fonts suggested was Lora and again I tried it out and decided it would fit well as a headings font.
    * All fonts have come from Google Fonts and this has been documented in the credits.

## **Current Features Common to all Pages**

#### **Favicon**

* The favicon is a small image that displays in the browser tab. 
* The intention is to enhance the user experience for those who have multiple tabs open and cannot read the text in the tabs.
* The favicon is a doodle of the planet Mercury.  This was chosen because Mercury is a planet people have head of inconjunction with astrology and is the ruler of my Gemini sun so in keeping with the flow of information provided about me on the website.
* It was taken from the Icons8 website and is credited in the Media Section below

​
#### **Navigation Bar:**
​
* I chose just to have my name on the left hand side as I still need to create a logo for myself and that will be added in future enhancements.  The navigation links are aligned on the right hand side.
* The user is given links to the about, offering, testimonials and contact sections.
* Each navigation link has the hover effect applied to it to provide a visual repsonse for users.
* The header is fully responsive and padding has been added to hero section to ensure that the fixed navigation bar does not block the header in the mobile version.
* In regards to mobiles and other smaller screens the navbar collapses to the hamburger icon to provide an optimal experiences for all users.
