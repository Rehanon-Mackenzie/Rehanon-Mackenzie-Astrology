        <p>Hey! My name is Rehanon and in case you're wondering <strong> I am a Gemini Sun, Leo Moon and Scorpio rising
          </strong>, so I was always going to be enamoured with the stars. I have been interested in how we tick ever
          since I was a little
          girl. I grew up with a Nan who was very much a kitchen witch. It wasn't until I was at school I realised not
          everyone had their tea leaves read or washed the front door down with mint for good luck and prosperity.

          <h2 class="text-center">About Me</h2>
          <div class="col-12">
            <p>A few years ago I found myself at a crossroads and leaning into astrology at a much deeper level as
              another means of assessing who I was and what I wanted. I trained as an evolutionary astrologer. I love
              this
              take on astrology because it really give folks a base to find out about the gifts and growth areas in
              their
              chart and provides practical guidance on how to flow with life rather than against it.</p>
            <p>Understanding your astrology for me is no different to checking the weather report before you head out
              for the day. Of course we can never be sure it is definitely going to rain but you will not regret
              packing
              your umbrella just in case. Knowing when the planets are passing through your own chart will give you
              the
              confidence to head out come rain or shine.</p>
            <p>I can't wait to help you unpick your own chart and truly work out who you are and what you came here
              for.
              My approach is light-hearted and down to earth but provides a clear roadmap to your best chapter yet.

                  everything in
