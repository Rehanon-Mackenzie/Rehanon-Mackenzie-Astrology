​

​
#### **Site Aims:**

​​
#### **Wireframes:**

Wireframes for all verions of the website were created on Balsamiq. This gave a clear focus for the layout of the various elements in each section.
#### **Laptop version**

#### **Mobile version**

<br>​

#### **Color Scheme:**
​
I used online palette generator Coolors to generate the following:

<br>

![Colour Palette](docs/images/colour-palette.png)

​I chose these colours because they are closely associated with spirituality specifically the chakra points.  These include purple for the crown chakra which is associated with higher wisdom.  Blue through the throat chakra and speaking from a place of wisdom. Finally, raspberry pink is associated with passion, excitement and creativity which is always what I hope a birth chart reading will give to people especially when they come for one when they are at a significant cross roasds in their life.

#### **Typography**
​
* Throughout the page, the following fonts are used:
    * Hind Madurai ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Hind+Madurai&display=swap') - I had researched fonts associated with spirituality and astrology and this was one that was suggested and I trialled it and liked it.  
    * Lora ('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lora&display=swap') - One of the other fonts suggested was Lora and again I tried it out and decided it would fit well as a headings font.
    * All fonts have come from Google Fonts and this has been documented in the credits.


​<br>

## **Current Features Common to all Pages**

#### **Favicon**

* The favicon is a small image that displays in the browser tab. 
* The intention is to enhance the user experience for those who have multiple tabs open and cannot read the text in the tabs.
* The favicon is a doodle of the planet Mercury.  This was chosen because Mercury is a planet people have head of inconjunction with astrology and is the ruler of my Gemini sun so in keeping with the flow of information provided about me on the website.
* It was taken from the Icons8 website and is credited in the Media Section below

​
#### **Navigation Bar:**
​
* I chose just to have my name on the left hand side as I still need to create a logo for myself and that will be added in future enhancements.  The navigation links are aligned on the right hand side.
* The user is given links to the about, offering, testimonials and contact sections.
* Each navigation link has the hover effect applied to it to provide a visual repsonse for users.
* The header is fully responsive and padding has been added to hero section to ensure that the fixed navigation bar does not block the header in the mobile version.
* In regards to mobiles and other smaller screens the navbar collapses to the hamburger icon to provide an optimal experiences for all users.

## **Features**
​
#### **Hero Section** 

![Screenshot of hero section](docs/images/hero.png)
* The main feature of this section is the hero image which I designed on Canva. Again it pulls in the colour purple which is associated with spirituality.
* The stars are the constellation of Taurus which is a simple but effective visaul which again is tying in with astrological theme.
* Furthermore the sign of Taurus is the first earth sign in the zodiac which ties in the message of the h2 that the astrology I practice is grounded and practical.
* The h1 and h2 is an italic because I felt it flowed with the design.
* The short intro paragraph gives a flavour of who I am and why I love astrology and is written to garner interest to carry on navigating the rest of the page.


<br> 

#### **About Section** 

![Screenshot of about Section](docs/images/about.png)
* There is a large profile picture of myself as a rounded object which was chosen because when trying a square object it felt too business like and less warm.
* The content follows on from the intro detailing how I found astrology useful, what I think astrology can offer generally and what guidance I can provide specifically.


<br>

#### **Offering Section**

![Screenshot of offering section](docs/images/offering.png)
* The testimonal section included an embedded video where I describe what a birth chart reading is and what benefits can be gained from it.
* I shot and edited the video myself using CapCut as detailed in the software section.
* The video uses a responsive class to ensure it renders properly in all the screen sizes.
* The video also is set to play in mute as per best practice.
* The text offers a summary of the service I offer and the cost which is something a perspective client will want to know.
<br>

#### **Testimonial Section**

![Screenshot of testimonial section](docs/images/testimonials.png)
* The testimonial sections comprises four testimonies from previous clients displayed on cards with the astrological sign of the client above their review which provides colour and interest alongside the text.
* The cards are set to display responsively offering all users a visual pleasing display.
* Media queries were applied to ensure a minimum height on the card text element so all the cards lined up uniformly in each screen size.  This is discussed in the bugs section.

<br>

#### **Contact Section**

![Screenshot of contact section](docs/images/contact.jpg)
* The form in the contact section displays responsively across all screen sizes.
* The required attribute was added to ensure both the first name and email have to be entered for it to submit.
* A free text space was provided so that clients cannot request a booking but can also send over any questions they may have.
<br>

#### **Thank you Page Content**
![Screenshot of thank you page](docs/images/thanks.png)
* The thank you page offers users confirmation that their message has been successfully sent and a timeframe in which they can expect to be responded to.
* My name logo at the top right of the screen will return the user to the website.

## **Future-Enhancements**
​
* I will be creating a logo for my astrology service and I will replace the current navbar brand with it.
* A separate page for offerings will be created as I would like to offer transit and solar return readings which would benefit from their own explanatory videos, which would sit better on a separate page.
* A booking calendar and payment system so they can purchase a reading immediately.

## **Testing Phase**
​
**Responsiveness**
* This was tested thoroughly using Chrome Dev tools.  This was incredibly helpful in enabling me to see anomalies that arose in the uniformity of the layout in the various size screens.
* It was especially useful when assessing how the video element in the offering section rendered across all screen sizes.
* I downloaded Live Server and I placed this side by side with my VS Code workspace so I could immediately see the effects of altering the code.
* I sent the link to friends and family so the responsiveness could be tested on Android as well my Apple devices.

**Functionality**

* The header and navigation bar clear and easy  to use and collapses responsively when required.
* The form inputs and submission work as they should.

* The link back to the index page on the thank you page works.

​

​
## **Bugs**
* 🐛 - The testimonial cards were not lining up correctly in the various screen sizes.
* 👷 - The card text element responsiveness meant they were only filling the space created by the text.
* 👍 - Added a media query for each screen size to ensure a minimum height so all cards lined up evenly. Re-tested and everything lined up perfectly.
<br>
* 🐛 - You could submit the form without filling it out.
* 👷 - The required attribute had not been placed on the input elements.
* 👍 - Added the attribute and the pop up message advised both the first name and email inputs should be filled out.
<br>
* 🐛 - The toggle on the hamburger menu had stopped working.
* 👷 - The closing tag had been deleted off the Bootstrap JS Link
* 👍 - Add the closing tag and retested the menu and it was toggling.


## **Unfixed Bugs**
* At present there are no unfixed bugs but I have added this section as new features will be added and this could bring fresh bugs.

## **Credits**

### **Content:**
* The Javascript used is part of the responsive navbar template in Bootstrap.
* The initial Lighthouse report advised the Large Contentful paint was slowing down the loading and bring peformance down and so I searched for a solution and was advised to add the fetch priority attribute by [Debug Bear](https://www.debugbear.com/blog/fetchpriority-attribute)
​
* The line of code I used was "<img src="photo.jpg" fetchpriority="high> and I placed this in the head element.

### **Media:**
* The planet mercury favicon came from icons8 and the link they asked to share is: (https://icons8.com/) and the direct link for the favicon is (https://icons8.com/icons/set/mercury-planet)
* The astrological symbols came from Flat Icon and the link is (https://www.flaticon.com/packs/horoscope-43)
### **Special Thanks**
* Thank you to friends and family who have sent me mountains of support when I was feeling out of my depth with the project. I'm very grateful to them for testing and retesting the site for me.
* I am also very grateful to my mentor, Richard Wells who was able to answer my questions and clear up any confusions I had as well as offering advice on how to further improve features on the site.
* Also a big thanks to my book club friends who have been very supporting and gave me a tapping routine to give me confidence in coding.  It worked!
* Finally, a huge thank you to  my dear departed Nan who got me interested in the stars in the first place and was always supportive of anything I decided to undertake.
