          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>Hey! My name is Rehanon and in case you're wondering <strong> I am Gemini Sun, Leo Moon and Scorpio rising
            </strong> so I was
            always going to be enamoured with the stars. I have been interested in how we tick ever since I was a little
            girl. I grew up with a Nan who was very much a kitchen witch. It wasn't unitl I was at school I realised not
            everyone had their tea leaves read or washed the front door down with mint for good luck and prosperity.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row justify-content-between">
        <div class="col-md p-5">
          <p>Then a few years ago I found myself at a crossroads and leaning into astrology at a much deeper level as
            another means of assessing how I was and what I wanted. I trained as an evolutionary astrologer. I love this
            take on astrology because it really give folks a base to find out about the gifts and growth areas in their
            chart and provides practical guidance on how to flow with life rather than against it.</p>
          <p>I can't wait to help you unpick your own chart and truly work out who you are and what you came here for.
            My approach is light-hearted and down to earth but provides a clear roadmap to your best chapter yet.</p>
